### Undergraduate tutoring 

Since the start of my PhD, I have been tutoring undergraduate modules offered at the School of Politics and International Relations. 
<br />
As part of my teaching responsibilities, I prepare and deliver 50-minute tutorial sessions in line with the module coordinator's instructions, I hold regular office hours, correspond with students and grade midterm essays as well as final exams.

  Following the Harvard Kennedy School case study method, I designed a case study to be used for undergraduate and graduate level courses on EU foreign policy, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Federica Bicchi](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-relations/people/bicchi). 
  
  The case study focuses on the role of the COREU network in Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common Security and Defense Policy decision-making. 
  
  The case study, which comes with a detailed teaching plan, is free and open-access. I was awarded a [certificate](/certificate.pdf) attesting to my skills in case study writing.
