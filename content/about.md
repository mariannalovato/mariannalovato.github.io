## My PhD project 

My current PhD project, titled *The rules of the game: How to bargain and win at the EU negotiating table - Understanding negotiation effectiveness in EU foreign policy*, investigates the reasons why certain member states are more successful than others in influencing EU foreign policy negotiations. I am focusing in particular on Common Foreign and Security Policy and Commond Security and Defense Policy (CFSP/CSDP) negotiations, including the policy debate on PESCO, operation EUBAM Libya, the sanctions against Russia and operation EUNAVFORMED IRINI. More broadly, I am interested in negotiation theory, CFSP/CSDP, European strategic autonomy. 


## Other research projects 

[1] Together with [Dr Heidi Maurer](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/heidi-maurer), I am currently working on an article on small EU member states' influence in EU policymaking. We are examining Ireland and Austria as case studies.

  <br />
  Small states are plenty in the EU, although European policy-making research focuses all too often on the impact of the French-German tandem in shaping positions and policies. This said, there is consensus that multilateral settings provide benefits in particular to smaller states. This article contributes to small state research by assessing the political strategies of Ireland and Austria in two distinct policy areas: foreign policy and trade. 
We start from previous work on small states (Grøn and Wivel 2011; Panke 2012, 2017; Thorhallsson and Wivel 2006) in that we consider smallness of EU member states not as a function of size or GDP alone. We depart, however, from this scholarship in that we propose a sociological institutionalist (Jenson and Mérand 2010) and social theory approach (Adler and Pouliot 2011; Adler-Nissen and Pouliot 2014) to “smallness”: actors are not defined by the properties that they exhibit, but through their interactions and practices. States are not “small”, because of what they are, but because of what they do. 
We therefore ask how two small EU member states (Ireland and Austria) in practice translate their skills into actual influence on EU foreign policy or EU trade policy. We compare the political strategies of Ireland, which is highly ambitious in its international commitment and political activism, with an EU member state that is less visible for its foreign policy ambition (Austria), although both define the issues at hand as highly salient (disarmament and nuclear proliferation for foreign policy; Mercosur agreement for trade). We also test for institutional effect of decision-making rules, about which academic scholarship disagrees (Naurin 2015; McKibben 2013; Häge 2013): while the Common Foreign and Security Policy with its unanimous decision-making credo asks for a consideration of all states (no matter if small or big), we assume that the more institutionalized nature of trade policy favors the political steering of an ambitious small state throughout all phases of the policy-making cycle.

[2] Together with [Assistant Professor Federica Bicchi](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-relations/people/bicchi), I am working on an article on the COREU network. 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <br />
  This paper will analyse the evolving practice of EU diplomatic communication via the COREU network, to show how it mirrors challenges to multilateralism in EU foreign policy. Created already in the 1970s as a way to pursue multilateral communications in-between EPC/CFSP meetings, the COREU network became crucial during negotiations for the 2004 enlargement. It experienced a dramatic decline in traffic since then, but the decline has not led to the system’s demise. Rather, the COREU system has evolved into a more targeted bureaucratic practice, with the EEAS using it predominantly to negotiate low-key declarations (via the silent assent procedure) or to spread low-key information. Plans for reform and increased security have been drafted for over two decades, but are not close to come to fruition, as diplomats use instead more flexible forms of communications that are both more user-friendly and less inclusive than the original COREU system.

[3] I am working on a paper exploring the dynamics at play between the EEAS, member states and other EU institutions in setting the CFSP/CSDP agenda. 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <br />
  Thirty years after the first formulation of CFSP, the number and type of actors shaping the CFSP agenda have evolved considerably – especially following the establishment of the EEAS and the expansion of the High Representative’s powers to include CFSP agenda-setting. These progressive changes call for an investigation of the ways in which member states and EU-level actors – from the HRVP and the EEAS to the Commission – have come to interact when setting the CFSP agenda.
Even though contestation remains part and parcel of EU foreign policy cooperation, member states and EU-level actors interact in more ways than one. While at times capitals and EU institutions cooperate with the Service and the HRVP to shape the CFSP/CSDP agenda, member states also co-opt the EEAS to secure their own interests (for instance, by appointing national officials to strategic positions within the Service) or openly contest the EEAS as too proactive – or not proactive enough – an agenda-setter. The goal of this paper is to establish under what conditions we should expect to see cooperation, contestation or co-optation in CFSP agenda-setting.
Relying on a wide array of empirical material, including semi-structured elite interviews and COREU data, the article investigates several CFSP/CSPD negotiations that have taken place since the beginning of HRVP Borrell’s term, from the renewal of EUNAVFOR MED Irini to the sanctions against Belarus.
In examining the dynamics at play in CFSP agenda-setting, the paper makes a number of important contributions. For one, it adds to the literature exploring the influence that member states and EU-level actors exert on CFSP agenda-setting. Moreover, by investigating the dynamics at play between capitals and EU institutions, the paper contributes to ongoing debates between intergovernmentalists and supranationalists on the nature of EU foreign policy.
