<p>Welcome! My name is Marianna Lovato and I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/spire/">School of Politics and International Relations</a> (University College Dublin), where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/ben.tonra">Professor Ben Tonra</a>.
<br />
I obtained my BA in Political Science from SciencesPo Paris (Reims Campus), spending an exchange year at Georgetown University. I have an MPhil in European Politics and Society from the University of Oxford. My MPhil thesis focused on the role played by domestic factors in moderating Italy&rsquo;s negotiation success at the EU level.</p>
<p>I am also a research assistant for the project <a href="https://europeanmoments.com">Europe&rsquo;s Stories</a>, based at the European Studies Centre (St Antony&rsquo;s College, Oxford) and led by <a href="https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/people/timothy-garton-ash">Professor Timothy Garton Ash</a>.</p>
<p>For more details, see my <a href="/resume.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-phd-project">My PhD project</h2>
<p>My current PhD project, titled <em>The rules of the game: How to bargain and win at the EU negotiating table - Understanding negotiation effectiveness in EU foreign policy</em>, investigates the reasons why certain member states are more successful than others in influencing EU foreign policy negotiations. I am focusing in particular on Common Foreign and Security Policy and Commond Security and Defense Policy (CFSP/CSDP) negotiations, including the policy debate on PESCO, operation EUBAM Libya and the sanctions against Russia.</p>

  <br />
  How do member states bargain and win at the European Union’s negotiation table? In recent years, EU member states have been increasingly called on to cooperate more closely to address global challenges – from migration to climate change. These developments beg for a systematic analysis of the factors leading to member states’ success in foreign policy negotiations. My thesis makes a much-needed contribution in this direction by asking the following: What makes some EU member states more successful than others in foreign policy negotiations?
<br />
The question is addressed in three phases. First, I introduce a salience-weighted conceptualization of negotiation success into the study of EU foreign policy for the first time. Second, I develop an innovative bargaining model to account for cross-national variation in member states’ negotiation success, which, as I argue, comes down to: (1) a country’s hard and soft power resources, (2) its ability to formulate clear and articulated policy positions, (3) its reputation within the Council, (4) its ability effectively to lobby EU-level actors (e.g. EEAS) and (5) the preference constellation at the EU level. Finally, relying on an original dataset collected by means of both expert interviews and an online survey filled by EU officials and national diplomats, I test the model quantitatively on three distinct CFSP/CSDP negotiations: the launch of operation EUBAM Libya in 2013, the agreement on the first round of sanctions against Russia in March 2014 and, lastly, the launch of the Permanent Structured Cooperation in December 2017. 
<br />
My thesis makes a number of significant contributions. For one, I apply a spatial bargaining model to the study of EU foreign policy negotiations for the first time. Additionally, I develop a model that accounts for factors that have thus far remained underexplored, such as the importance of lobbying EU institutions and of formulating well-defined domestic positions from the onset of the negotiations. Moreover, I examine a set of negotiations that capture major underlining divisions in EU foreign policy, from the Atlanticist versus Europeanist divide that emerged in the PESCO discussions to the cleavage on migration characterizing the negotiations on EUBAM Libya.

<p>More broadly, I am interested in <strong>negotiation theory</strong>, <strong>CFSP/CSDP</strong>, <strong>European strategic autonomy</strong>.</p>
